However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything."

In Scientific Research, experimental results are primarily communicated through plots, diagrams, and statistical visualizations. These contain core discoveries that remain invisible to text-only systems. Financial Analysis relies heavily on market charts, correlation matrices, and performance tables. Investment insights are encoded in visual patterns rather than textual descriptions. Additionally, Medical Literature Analysis depends on radiological images, diagnostic charts, and clinical data tables. These contain life-critical information essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions. Current RAG frameworks systematically exclude these vital knowledge sources across all three scenarios. This creates fundamental gaps that render them inadequate for real-world applications requiring comprehensive information understanding. Therefore, multimodal RAG emerges as a critical advancement. It is necessary to bridge these knowledge gaps and enable truly comprehensive intelligence across all modalities of human knowledge representation."

These inherent limitations necessitate the design of effective technical components. Such components must be specifically designed to handle multimodal complexity and preserve the full spectrum of information contained within diverse content types."

This architecture addresses the fundamental limitation of existing approaches that rely solely on embedding-based retrieval or keyword matching. RAG-Anything leverages explicit graph relationships to capture multi-hop reasoning patterns. It simultaneously employs dense vector representations to identify semantically relevant content that lacks direct structural connections. The framework introduces modality-aware query processing and cross-modal alignment systems. These enable textual queries to effectively access visual and structured information. This unified approach eliminates the architectural fragmentation that plagues current multimodal RAG systems. It delivers superior performance particularly on long-context documents where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities and document sections."

To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging multimodal benchmarks: DocBench and MMLongBench. Our evaluation demonstrates that RAG-Anything achieves superior performance across diverse domains. The framework represents substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, our performance gains become increasingly significant as content length increases. We observe particularly pronounced advantages on long-context materials. This validates our core hypothesis"

Existing frameworks operate under the restrictive assumption that knowledge corpus consists exclusively of plain textual documents.

Real-world knowledge repositories are inherently heterogeneous and multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured data, and mathematical expressions. These diverse knowledge sources span multiple document formats and presentation mediums, from research papers and technical slides to web pages and interactive documents."

The proposed RAG-Anything addresses this challenge through a dual-graph construction strategy. The system first builds a cross-modal knowledge graph that faithfully grounds non-textual modalities within their contextual environment. It then constructs a text-based knowledge graph using established text-centric extraction pipelines. These complementary graphs are merged through entity alignment. This design ensures accurate cross-modal grounding and comprehensive coverage of textual semantics, enabling richer knowledge representation and robust retrieval."

Traditional RAG methods face significant limitations when dealing with multimodal documents. They typically rely on semantic similarity within single modalities and fail to capture the rich interconnections between visual, mathematical, tabular, and textual elements. To address these challenges, our framework introduces a cross-modal hybrid retrieval mechanism. This mechanism leverages structural knowledge and semantic representations across heterogeneous modalities."

For the retrieval pipeline, we employ the text-embedding-3-large model with 3072-dimensional embeddings. We use the bge-reranker-v2-m3 model for reranking. For graph-based RAG methods, we enforce a combined entity-and-relation token limit of 20,000 tokens and a chunk token limit of 12,000 tokens."

RAG-Anything introduces a comprehensive dual-graph construction strategy that preserves structural relationships across all modalities.

The framework excels where relevant evidence is dispersed across multiple modalities and sections. It achieves the best results in information-dense domains such as Research Reports and Financial Reports on MMLongBench. These improvements stem from the structured context injection mechanism. This mechanism integrates dual-graph construction for cross-page entity alignment. It combines semantic retrieval with structural navigation. The framework also employs modality-aware processing for efficient context window utilization. Unlike baselines that cannot uniformly process diverse modalities, RAG-Anything effectively captures scattered multimodal evidence. Its cross-modal hybrid retrieval architecture combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic similarity matching. This enables the framework to leverage both explicit relationships and implicit semantic connections across modalities."

However, RAG-Anything's advantages become increasingly pronounced as document length grows. On DocBench, the performance gap expands dramatically to over 13 points for documents exceeding 100 pages (68.2% vs."

In contrast, RAG-Anything builds modality-aware graphs that preserve essential relationships (e.g., table header "

The edges capture key relationships: row-of, column-of, header-applies-to, and unit-of. This structure enables precise navigation. The retriever focuses on the row \"Wages and salaries\" and the column for \"2020\". It directs attention to the target cell (26,778 million). The system successfully disambiguates nearby entries like \"Share-based payments.\" Competing methods treat tables as linear text. They often confuse numerical spans and years. This leads to significantly inaccurate answers. RAG-Anything explicitly models relationships within the table. It achieves precise selection and numeric grounding. This ensures accurate responses."

Traditional RAG systems struggle with these scenarios due to lack of structural understanding. Even MMGraphRAG fails here because it only considers image modality entities. It ignores other modality entities like table cells, row headers, and column headers. RAG-Anything's comprehensive graph representation captures all modality-specific entities and their relationships. This enables precise, modality-specific grounding that leads to consistent improvements in document Q&A tasks requiring fine-grained localization. Additional cases are available in Appendix A.2."

First, graph construction approaches optimize structures for retrieval efficiency, ranging from LightRAG's (Guo et al., 2024) sparsified indices to neural models like GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) and memory-augmented variants like HippoRAG (Jimenez Gutierrez et al., 2024). Second, knowledge aggregation approaches integrate information for multi-level reasoning through hierarchical methods like RAPTOR (Sarthi et al., 2024) and ArchRAG (Wang et al., 2025). Despite these advances, existing systems remain text-centric with homogeneous inputs. This limits their applicability to multimodal documents and constrains robust reasoning over heterogeneous content. RAG-Anything addresses this gap by extending GraphRAG to all modalities."

Multimodal RAG represents a natural evolution from text-based RAG systems, addressing the need to integrate external knowledge from diverse data modalities for comprehensive response generation (Abootorabi et al., 2025). However, current approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on modality-specific architectures. Existing methods demonstrate these constraints across domains: VideoRAG (Ren et al., 2025) employs dual-channel architectures for video understanding while MM-VID (Lin et al., 2023) converts videos to text, losing visual information; VisRAG (Yu et al., 2025) preserves document layouts as images but misses granular relationships; MMGraphRAG (Wan & Yu, 2025) links scene graphs with textual representations but suffers from structural blindness—treating tables and formulas as plain text without proper entity extraction, losing structural information for reasoning."

Current systems require specialized processing pipelines for each modality. This creates poor generalizability as new modalities demand custom architectures and fusion mechanisms. Such fragmentation introduces cross-modal alignment difficulties, modality biases, and information bottlenecks. These issues systematically compromise system performance and scalability. RAG-Anything addresses this fragmentation through a unified graph-based framework. Our approach processes all modalities with consistent structured modeling. This eliminates architectural constraints while preserving multimodal information integrity. The result is seamless cross-modal reasoning across heterogeneous content."

Our core technical innovation is the dual-graph construction strategy that seamlessly integrates cross-modal and text-based knowledge graphs. Rather than forcing diverse modalities into text-centric pipelines that lose critical structural information, our approach fundamentally reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities with rich semantic relationships. The hybrid retrieval mechanism strategically combines structural navigation with semantic matching, enabling precise reasoning over complex document layouts. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates superior performance on long-context documents, particularly those exceeding 100 pages where traditional methods fail. This work establishes a new foundation for multimodal RAG systems that can handle the heterogeneous nature of diverse information landscapes."

Two fundamental issues emerge through systematic failure case examination. First, systems exhibit text-centric retrieval bias, preferentially accessing textual sources even when queries explicitly require visual information. Second, rigid spatial processing patterns fail to adapt to non-standard document layouts. These limitations manifest in cross-modal misalignment scenarios and structurally ambiguous tables. The findings highlight the need for adaptive spatial reasoning and layout-aware parsing mechanisms to handle real-world multimodal document complexity."

Research reports, tutorials, and academic papers maintain moderate lengths of 35–58 pages on average, while guidebooks extend to approximately 78 pages. Brochures and administrative files remain relatively compact, whereas financial reports again emerge as the longest category."

This structured representation enables the system to correctly isolate the Evidence Inference dataset context and identify \"GloVe + LSTM - Attention\" with a score of 0.506 as the optimal configuration. By explicitly preserving hierarchical table constraints that other methods often collapse or misinterpret, RAG-Anything ensures reliable reasoning across complex multi-dataset tabular structures."

Understanding where and why these systems break down is crucial for advancing the field beyond current performance plateaus. Examining failure patterns helps identify fundamental architectural bottlenecks and design principles for more robust multimodal systems. Our investigation reveals two critical failure patterns exposing deeper systemic issues in multimodal RAG architectures. These patterns are not merely edge cases but reflect fundamental challenges in cross-modal information integration and structural reasoning:"

Most systems default to sequential scanning patterns—top-to-bottom and left-to-right—that mirror natural reading conventions. While effective for simple text documents, this approach creates systematic failures with structurally complex real-world content. Many documents require non-conventional processing strategies. Tables demand column-wise interpretation, technical diagrams follow specific directional flows, and scientific figures embed critical information in unexpectedly positioned annotations. These structural variations are prevalent in professional documents, making adaptive spatial reasoning essential."

The system's inability to recognize and adapt to this structural requirement led to systematic misinterpretation.

When spatial processing patterns are misaligned with document structure, the extracted information becomes not merely incomplete but actively misleading.

The primary failure stems from the table's confusing design: the GEM row lacks dedicated cell boundaries, and the \"Joint\" and \"Slot\" columns merge without clear separation. These structural irregularities create parsing ambiguities that systematically mislead extraction algorithms. This failure pattern reveals a critical vulnerability in current RAG systems. When table structures deviate from standard formatting conventions—through merged cells, unclear boundaries, or non-standard layouts—extraction methods consistently misinterpret cell relationships and conflate distinct data values. This exposes the brittleness of current approaches when faced with real-world document variations that deviate from clean, structured formats."
